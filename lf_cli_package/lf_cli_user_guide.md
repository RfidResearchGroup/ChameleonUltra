## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before installing the enhanced LF CLI, ensure that your system meets the following requirements. The enhanced CLI builds upon the existing Chameleon Ultra software framework and requires a properly configured Python environment with the necessary dependencies.

Your system must have Python 3.9 or later installed, as the enhanced CLI utilizes modern Python features and type annotations that require recent Python versions. The implementation has been tested with Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms, ensuring broad compatibility across different operating systems and environments.

The Chameleon Ultra device firmware must be version 2.0 or later to support the complete range of LF protocol commands. Earlier firmware versions may support basic EM410x operations but lack the comprehensive protocol support that the enhanced CLI provides. Users with older firmware should update to the latest version before proceeding with the enhanced CLI installation.

### Installation Process

The installation process involves several steps that integrate the enhanced LF CLI components with the existing Chameleon Ultra software. Begin by ensuring that the standard Chameleon Ultra CLI is properly installed and functional, as the enhanced LF CLI extends rather than replaces the existing functionality.

Download the enhanced LF CLI components, which consist of three main files: the core framework module (chameleon_cli_lf_enhanced.py), the protocol implementations module (chameleon_lf_protocols.py), and the command extensions module (chameleon_lf_commands.py). These files should be placed in the same directory as the existing Chameleon Ultra CLI files, typically in the software/script directory of the Chameleon Ultra repository.

The integration process requires modifying the existing CLI initialization to include the enhanced LF components. This involves importing the enhanced modules and calling the extension functions that add LF commands to the existing command tree structure. The integration is designed to be non-invasive, preserving all existing functionality while adding comprehensive LF support.

### Configuration and Verification

After installing the enhanced LF CLI components, verify the installation by connecting your Chameleon Ultra device and testing basic functionality. The enhanced CLI includes diagnostic commands that can verify proper installation and device compatibility.

Use the 'lf info' command to display information about supported LF protocols and verify that the enhanced CLI is properly loaded. This command should display a comprehensive list of supported protocols including EM410x, T5577, HID Prox, Indala, and others, confirming that the enhanced CLI components are properly integrated.

Test device connectivity using the 'hw connect' command followed by 'lf scan' to verify that the device can perform LF operations. The scan command will attempt to detect any LF cards in the vicinity and should complete without errors, indicating that the device firmware and enhanced CLI are properly communicating.

Configure any necessary device settings such as antenna tuning and power levels using the enhanced CLI's configuration commands. The 'lf tune' command can be used to optimize antenna performance for LF operations, ensuring reliable card detection and communication.

## Quick Start Guide

### Basic Operations

The enhanced LF CLI follows the same command structure as the existing Chameleon Ultra CLI, with LF commands organized under the 'lf' command group. All LF operations begin with the 'lf' prefix followed by protocol-specific subcommands that provide access to reading, writing, and emulation functionality.

Begin by connecting your Chameleon Ultra device using the 'hw connect' command, which establishes communication with the device and prepares it for LF operations. The device will automatically detect the connected Chameleon Ultra and display connection status information.

Perform a general LF scan using the 'lf scan' command to detect any LF cards in the vicinity. This command attempts to identify cards using multiple protocols and provides information about detected cards including protocol type and basic identification data.

### Reading LF Cards

Reading LF cards involves using protocol-specific read commands that are optimized for each card type. The enhanced CLI provides dedicated read commands for each supported protocol, ensuring optimal performance and compatibility with different card types and manufacturers.

For EM410x cards, use the 'lf em 410x read' command, which will scan for EM410x cards and display the 5-byte card identifier in multiple formats. The command provides options for output formatting and verbose information display, allowing users to customize the output according to their needs.

T5577 cards require block-based reading using the 'lf t55xx read' command with appropriate block number specifications. T5577 cards contain 8 blocks of data, with block 0 containing configuration information and blocks 1-7 containing user data. The read command supports password-protected cards and provides detailed formatting options.

HID Prox cards use the 'lf hid read' command, which automatically detects and decodes HID format information including facility codes and card numbers. The command supports multiple HID formats and provides detailed information about card structure and encoding.

### Writing and Cloning Cards

Writing and cloning operations enable users to duplicate existing cards or create new cards with specified data. The enhanced CLI provides comprehensive writing capabilities for programmable cards such as T5577, which can emulate various LF protocols.

Clone EM410x cards using the 'lf em 410x write' command with the target card's identifier. This command programs a T5577 card to emulate the specified EM410x card, creating a functional duplicate that will be recognized by EM410x readers.

Direct T5577 programming uses the 'lf t55xx write' command with block and data specifications. This low-level approach allows precise control over T5577 configuration and data, enabling advanced cloning scenarios and custom card creation.

HID Prox cloning uses the 'lf hid write' command with facility code and card number parameters. The command automatically handles HID format encoding and T5577 configuration, creating a functional HID Prox duplicate.

### Emulation Operations

Emulation operations allow the Chameleon Ultra device to simulate LF cards, enabling testing of reader systems and access control implementations. The enhanced CLI provides comprehensive emulation support for all supported LF protocols.

Configure EM410x emulation using the 'lf em 410x econfig' command with the desired card identifier. The emulation configuration is stored in the device's slot system, allowing multiple emulation profiles to be maintained simultaneously.

Activate emulation by switching the device to emulation mode using 'hw mode emulation' and selecting the appropriate slot containing the emulation configuration. The device will then respond to reader queries as if it were the configured card type.

Monitor emulation activity using the device's status commands and LED indicators, which provide feedback about reader interactions and emulation status. The enhanced CLI includes commands for monitoring emulation performance and troubleshooting emulation issues.

## Protocol Reference

### EM410x Protocol

The EM410x protocol represents one of the most widely deployed LF RFID standards, utilizing Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) modulation at 125kHz frequency. EM410x cards contain a 5-byte identifier that is transmitted continuously when the card is energized by a reader's RF field. The protocol's simplicity and reliability have made it a popular choice for access control systems, animal identification, and various tracking applications.

EM410x cards use a specific data structure that includes version information, customer identification, and data codes. The 5-byte identifier is typically displayed as a 10-character hexadecimal string, with each byte representing different components of the card's identity. The first byte often contains version or manufacturer information, while the remaining bytes contain the unique identifier assigned to the card.

The enhanced CLI provides comprehensive EM410x support including reading, writing to T5577 cards, and emulation capabilities. Reading operations automatically detect EM410x cards and decode the identifier information, providing multiple output formats and detailed card information. Writing operations enable cloning of EM410x cards to T5577 programmable cards, creating functional duplicates that are indistinguishable from original cards to reader systems.

EM410x emulation allows the Chameleon Ultra device to simulate any EM410x card by responding to reader queries with the configured identifier. The emulation is implemented at the protocol level, ensuring compatibility with all EM410x reader systems regardless of manufacturer or specific implementation details.

### T5577 Protocol

The T5577 represents a sophisticated programmable LF RFID card that can emulate various LF protocols through software configuration. Unlike fixed-format cards such as EM410x, the T5577 contains configurable modulation settings, data encoding options, and security features that enable it to mimic the behavior of numerous other LF card types.

T5577 cards contain 8 blocks of 32-bit data, with block 0 serving as the configuration block that determines the card's operational parameters. The configuration block specifies modulation type (ASK, FSK, or PSK), bit rate, maximum block number, password protection settings, and other operational parameters. Blocks 1-7 contain user data that is transmitted according to the configuration specified in block 0.

The modulation capabilities of T5577 cards enable them to emulate cards that use different modulation schemes. ASK modulation supports EM410x and similar protocols, FSK modulation enables HID Prox emulation, and PSK modulation allows Indala card emulation. The enhanced CLI provides commands for configuring T5577 cards for each of these modulation types with appropriate parameters.

Password protection features of T5577 cards provide security against unauthorized reading and writing operations. When password protection is enabled, all read and write operations require the correct 4-byte password to succeed. The enhanced CLI supports password-protected T5577 operations through optional password parameters in read and write commands.

### HID Prox Protocol

HID Prox represents a proprietary LF RFID protocol developed by HID Global for access control applications. The protocol utilizes Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation at 125kHz and supports various data formats with different bit lengths and encoding schemes. HID Prox cards are widely deployed in corporate and institutional access control systems due to their security features and reliable performance.

The most common HID Prox format is the 26-bit format, which includes facility code and card number fields along with parity bits for error detection. The facility code identifies the organization or system that issued the card, while the card number provides a unique identifier within that facility. This hierarchical structure enables large-scale deployments with multiple facilities while maintaining unique card identification.

HID Prox cards use sophisticated encoding schemes that include parity checking and error detection mechanisms. The enhanced CLI automatically handles these encoding requirements, allowing users to specify facility codes and card numbers in decimal format while the system handles the complex bit-level encoding required for proper HID Prox operation.

Security features of HID Prox include proprietary encoding algorithms and format specifications that are not publicly documented. However, the enhanced CLI includes reverse-engineered implementations that provide compatibility with standard HID Prox readers while enabling security testing and research activities.

### Indala Protocol

Indala represents another proprietary LF RFID protocol that utilizes Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulation for data transmission. Indala cards are commonly used in access control systems and animal identification applications, particularly in environments where the unique characteristics of PSK modulation provide advantages over ASK or FSK systems.

The Indala protocol supports various identifier lengths and encoding schemes, with 64-bit and 224-bit formats being most common. The enhanced CLI provides support for standard Indala formats while allowing flexibility for custom implementations and research applications. Indala cards typically contain unique identifiers that are assigned by the manufacturer and cannot be changed, making them suitable for high-security applications.

PSK modulation used by Indala cards provides certain advantages in noisy RF environments, as phase-based encoding is less susceptible to amplitude variations and interference. This makes Indala cards particularly suitable for industrial environments and outdoor applications where RF interference may be present.

The enhanced CLI provides comprehensive Indala support including reading, T5577-based cloning, and emulation capabilities. The implementation handles the complex PSK demodulation and encoding requirements automatically, allowing users to work with Indala cards using simple command-line interfaces.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Reading and Cloning an EM410x Card

This comprehensive example demonstrates the complete process of reading an EM410x card and creating a functional clone using a T5577 programmable card. The process involves card detection, data extraction, T5577 programming, and verification of the cloned card.

Begin by ensuring that your Chameleon Ultra device is properly connected and configured for LF operations. Use the 'hw connect' command to establish communication with the device, followed by 'hw mode reader' to configure the device for card reading operations. The device should indicate successful connection and mode configuration.

Place the target EM410x card near the Chameleon Ultra's LF antenna and execute the read command with verbose output to gather comprehensive information about the card. The command 'lf em 410x read --verbose --format hex' will scan for the card and display detailed information including the card identifier, protocol characteristics, and suggested cloning commands.

```bash
$ lf em 410x read --verbose --format hex
Reading EM410x card...
EM410x card detected!
========================================
ID (HEX): 1234567890
Detailed Information:
Protocol: EM410x
Modulation: ASK
Frequency: 125kHz
ID Length: 5 bytes
Version: 0x12
Customer ID: 13330
Data Code: 26768

Commands to clone this card:
lf em 410x write --id 1234567890
lf t55xx write --block 1 --data 12345678
lf t55xx write --block 2 --data 90000000
```

Remove the original EM410x card and place a blank T5577 card near the antenna. Execute the write command using the identifier obtained from the read operation. The command 'lf em 410x write --id 1234567890 --verify' will program the T5577 card with the EM410x identifier and verify the programming by reading back the card.

```bash
$ lf em 410x write --id 1234567890 --verify
Writing EM410x ID to T55xx card...
ID: 1234567890
Write completed successfully!
Verifying write...
Verification successful!
```

Test the cloned card by using it with the original reader system or by reading it with the Chameleon Ultra to confirm that it produces the same identifier as the original card. The cloned card should be functionally identical to the original and should be accepted by any EM410x reader system.

### Example 2: Configuring T5577 for Custom Protocol Emulation

This example demonstrates advanced T5577 configuration for emulating custom or non-standard LF protocols. The process involves understanding T5577 configuration parameters, calculating appropriate settings, and programming the card for specific protocol requirements.

Begin by reading the current T5577 configuration to understand the card's current state and identify any existing configuration that might interfere with the new setup. Use the command 'lf t55xx info' to display comprehensive configuration information and data block contents.

```bash
$ lf t55xx info
Reading T5577 card information...
T5577 Card Configuration:
========================================
Config Block: 00088040
Modulation: Direct (ASK/OOK) (0)
Bit Rate: 0
Max Block: 2
Password Mode: Disabled
Master Key: 0x0

Data Blocks:
Block 1: 12345678
Block 2: 90ABCDEF
Block 3: 00000000
Block 4: 00000000
Block 5: 00000000
Block 6: 00000000
Block 7: 00000000
```

Configure the T5577 for FSK modulation to emulate an HID Prox card. This requires setting the modulation type to FSK1, configuring appropriate bit rate, and setting the maximum block number for the data structure. Use the command 'lf t55xx config --modulation fsk1 --bitrate 2 --maxblock 3 --verify' to apply the configuration.

```bash
$ lf t55xx config --modulation fsk1 --bitrate 2 --maxblock 3 --verify
Configuring T5577 card...
Modulation: FSK1
Bit Rate: 2
Max Block: 3
Configuration written successfully!
Config: 00148060
Verifying configuration...
Verification successful!
```

Program the data blocks with the specific data pattern required for the target protocol. For HID Prox emulation, this involves encoding the facility code and card number according to HID specifications and distributing the data across multiple blocks as required by the protocol.

```bash
$ lf t55xx write --block 1 --data 2006EC8C --verify
Writing to T5577 block 1...
Data: 2006EC8C
Write completed successfully!
Verifying write...
Verification successful!

$ lf t55xx write --block 2 --data 00000000 --verify
Writing to T5577 block 2...
Data: 00000000
Write completed successfully!
Verifying write...
Verification successful!
```

Verify the complete configuration by reading the card information again and testing the card with appropriate reader systems. The configured T5577 should now respond as the target protocol type and should be recognized by compatible readers.

### Example 3: Setting Up HID Prox Emulation

This example demonstrates the complete process of configuring HID Prox emulation on the Chameleon Ultra device, including reading an existing HID card, configuring emulation parameters, and testing the emulation functionality.

Begin by reading an existing HID Prox card to obtain the facility code and card number that will be used for emulation. Place the HID card near the Chameleon Ultra antenna and use the read command with verbose output to gather detailed information about the card structure and encoding.

```bash
$ lf hid read --verbose --timeout 10
Reading HID Prox card...
HID Prox card detected!
========================================
Raw Data: 2006EC8C00000000
Facility Code: 123
Card Number: 4567
Format: 26-bit (assumed)

Detailed Information:
Protocol: HID Prox
Modulation: FSK
Frequency: 125kHz
Data Length: 8 bytes
Binary: 00100000000001101110110010001100
Bit breakdown (26-bit format):
  Parity: 0
  Facility: 01111011 (123)
  Card: 0001000111000111 (4567)
  Parity: 0

Commands to clone this card:
lf hid write --facility 123 --card 4567
```

Configure HID Prox emulation using the facility code and card number obtained from the read operation. Select an appropriate slot for the emulation configuration and use the econfig command to store the HID parameters in the device's emulation system.

```bash
$ lf hid econfig --slot 2 --facility 123 --card 4567
HID Prox emulation configured successfully!
Slot: 2
Facility Code: 123
Card Number: 4567
Format: 26-bit

To activate emulation:
1. Switch to emulation mode: hw mode emulation
2. Select this slot: hw slot select --slot 2
```

Activate the emulation by switching the device to emulation mode and selecting the configured slot. The device will then respond to HID Prox reader queries with the configured facility code and card number, effectively emulating the original card.

```bash
$ hw mode emulation
Switched to emulation mode successfully.

$ hw slot select --slot 2
Selected slot 2 for emulation.
Current emulation: HID Prox (Facility: 123, Card: 4567)
```

Test the emulation by presenting the Chameleon Ultra device to HID Prox readers or by using another Chameleon Ultra device in reader mode to verify that the emulation is functioning correctly. The emulated card should be recognized and accepted by HID Prox reader systems.

### Example 4: Batch Processing Multiple Cards

This example demonstrates batch processing capabilities for handling multiple LF cards efficiently, including automated reading, data logging, and batch cloning operations. This approach is particularly useful for large-scale card management and migration projects.

Create a script that automates the reading process for multiple cards, logging the results to a file for later analysis and processing. The script should handle different card types and provide comprehensive logging of all detected cards and their characteristics.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Batch card reading script
echo "Starting batch card reading session..."
echo "Card data will be logged to cards.log"

for i in {1..50}; do
    echo "=== Card $i ===" >> cards.log
    echo "Please present card $i and press Enter..."
    read
    
    # Try different protocols
    echo "Scanning for EM410x..." >> cards.log
    lf em 410x read --format hex >> cards.log 2>&1
    
    echo "Scanning for HID Prox..." >> cards.log
    lf hid read >> cards.log 2>&1
    
    echo "Scanning for Indala..." >> cards.log
    lf indala read >> cards.log 2>&1
    
    echo "" >> cards.log
done

echo "Batch reading completed. Check cards.log for results."
```

Process the logged data to extract card information and generate cloning commands for each detected card. This involves parsing the log file, extracting relevant data, and generating appropriate write commands for each card type.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Process card log and generate cloning commands
import re

def process_card_log(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    cards = []
    sections = content.split('=== Card ')
    
    for section in sections[1:]:  # Skip first empty section
        card_num = section.split(' ===')[0]
        
        # Extract EM410x data
        em_match = re.search(r'ID \(HEX\): ([A-F0-9]{10})', section)
        if em_match:
            em_id = em_match.group(1)
            cards.append(f"# Card {card_num} - EM410x")
            cards.append(f"lf em 410x write --id {em_id}")
            cards.append("")
        
        # Extract HID data
        hid_facility = re.search(r'Facility Code: (\d+)', section)
        hid_card = re.search(r'Card Number: (\d+)', section)
        if hid_facility and hid_card:
            facility = hid_facility.group(1)
            card_num_val = hid_card.group(1)
            cards.append(f"# Card {card_num} - HID Prox")
            cards.append(f"lf hid write --facility {facility} --card {card_num_val}")
            cards.append("")
    
    return cards

# Generate cloning script
cloning_commands = process_card_log('cards.log')
with open('clone_cards.sh', 'w') as f:
    f.write("#!/bin/bash\n")
    f.write("# Generated cloning commands\n\n")
    for command in cloning_commands:
        f.write(command + "\n")

print("Cloning script generated: clone_cards.sh")
```

Execute the batch cloning process using the generated script, with appropriate prompts for T5577 card placement and verification of each cloning operation. The script should include error handling and verification steps to ensure successful cloning.

### Example 5: Security Testing Scenario

This comprehensive example demonstrates using the enhanced LF CLI for security testing of an access control system, including reconnaissance, card cloning, and access testing procedures.

Begin the security assessment by performing reconnaissance to identify the types of LF cards used in the target system. Use the general scan command to detect cards carried by authorized personnel and identify the protocols and card types in use.

```bash
$ lf scan --verbose --timeout 10
Scanning for LF cards...
Timeout: 10 seconds

Trying EM410X...
Found EM410x card!
ID: 1234567890

Trying T5577...
  T5577: No response

Trying HID_PROX...
  HID_PROX: No response

Trying INDALA...
  INDALA: No response
```

Document the discovered card types and gather detailed information about each card's characteristics. This information will be used to plan the cloning and testing approach.

```bash
$ lf em 410x read --verbose
Reading EM410x card...
EM410x card detected!
========================================
ID (HEX): 1234567890

Detailed Information:
Protocol: EM410x
Modulation: ASK
Frequency: 125kHz
ID Length: 5 bytes
Version: 0x12
Customer ID: 13330
Data Code: 26768
```

Create cloned cards using T5577 programmable cards and verify that the clones function correctly with the target reader system. Test the cloned cards in a controlled environment before attempting to use them with the actual access control system.

```bash
$ lf em 410x write --id 1234567890 --verify
Writing EM410x ID to T55xx card...
ID: 1234567890
Write completed successfully!
Verifying write...
Verification successful!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

LF operations can be affected by various environmental and technical factors that may cause intermittent failures or reduced performance. Understanding these factors and their solutions is essential for reliable operation of the enhanced LF CLI.

Card detection failures are among the most common issues encountered in LF operations. These failures can result from improper card positioning, insufficient RF power, environmental interference, or card damage. When experiencing detection failures, first verify that the card is positioned correctly relative to the Chameleon Ultra's LF antenna, typically within 2-3 centimeters of the device.

Environmental interference can significantly impact LF operations, particularly in environments with strong electromagnetic fields or metal objects near the antenna. Fluorescent lighting, computer monitors, and metal desks can all interfere with LF communications. When experiencing intermittent failures, try moving to a different location or repositioning the device away from potential interference sources.

Power-related issues can affect both card detection and writing operations. Some cards require higher RF power levels for reliable operation, while others may be damaged by excessive power. The enhanced CLI includes power control commands that can be used to optimize power levels for specific card types and operational requirements.

Different LF protocols have unique characteristics and requirements that can cause protocol-specific issues. Understanding these characteristics is important for troubleshooting protocol-related problems.

EM410x issues are typically related to card positioning or power levels, as EM410x cards have relatively low power requirements and should be easily detected under normal conditions. If EM410x cards are not being detected, verify antenna positioning and check for environmental interference.

T5577 issues can be more complex due to the programmable nature of these cards. Configuration errors, password protection, and modulation settings can all affect T5577 operations. When experiencing T5577 issues, try reading the configuration block to verify current settings and ensure that the correct password is being used if password protection is enabled.

HID Prox issues are often related to the complex encoding schemes used by HID cards. Format detection failures or incorrect decoding can occur with non-standard HID formats or damaged cards. The enhanced CLI includes diagnostic commands that can help identify HID format issues and provide guidance for manual format specification.

Indala issues are typically related to PSK demodulation requirements, which are more sensitive to positioning and interference than ASK or FSK protocols. Ensure optimal card positioning and minimal interference when working with Indala cards.

### Performance Optimization

Optimizing performance of LF operations involves understanding the factors that affect operation speed and reliability, and configuring the system for optimal performance under specific conditions.

Antenna tuning is critical for optimal LF performance and should be performed regularly, particularly when changing operational environments or card types. The enhanced CLI includes antenna tuning commands that can optimize performance for specific frequency ranges and card types.

Timeout settings affect both operation speed and reliability. Shorter timeouts provide faster operation but may cause failures with slow-responding cards, while longer timeouts improve reliability but reduce operation speed. Adjust timeout settings based on the specific cards and operational requirements.

Power level optimization can improve both detection reliability and operation speed. Higher power levels improve detection of weak cards but may cause interference or damage to sensitive cards. The enhanced CLI provides power control commands that enable optimization for specific scenarios.

Environmental optimization involves minimizing interference sources and optimizing physical setup for reliable operation. This includes positioning the device away from interference sources, using appropriate work surfaces, and maintaining consistent card positioning during operations.
