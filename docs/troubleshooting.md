# Hardware

## Difficulties to get emulation working properly

Try with waking up the Chameleon by pressing a button before presenting it to the reader. Try with keeping some 2-3 cm distance to the reader.

## Difficulties to get the LF working properly

The LF antenna is on a second PCB attached to the main PCB via little screws which also serve as electric connection.
It has reported that on some devices the electric connection is not good, some glue or resin residues may interfere.
You can try to dismantle very gently the screws and PCB, clean them and put them back in place.
Be very careful the screws have been reported to be quite fragile so be gentle with them!

# BLE

## Difficulties connecting using BLE

On Android make sure your location is turned, as that allows for scanning of bluetooth devices.

## Difficulties to use BLE

After BLE pairing, both the phone and ChameleonUltra will save a secret key for encrypted communication. If either party deletes the pairing record, it will result in communication failure. If Bluetooth cannot be connected, clearing the pairing information on the other side can solve the problem:

* Find the Bluetooth settings in the phone's system settings and cancel pairing with the ChameleonUltra.
* In the CLI of ChameleonUltra, execute the `hw settings bleclearbonds` command to clear all pairing records.

Default BLE connect key(passkey) is `123456`

# DFU

## Error when attempting DFU upgrade with `nrfutil`


```
[00:00:00] ------   0% [id:9] Failed, [sdfu] [json.exception.type_error.302] type must be string, but is null
```
or
```
[00:00:00] ------   0% [2/2 ...] Failed, [sdfu]
```

### Check permissions and ModemManager

Check the serial port permissions and if under Linux, make sure ModemManager is not interfering with your Chameleon.
The proposed [udev/rules.d file](../resource/driver/79-chameleon-usb-device-blacklist-dialout.rules) may help you (and add your user to the dialout group).

### Check `hw_version` of your DFU package

Another cause of this error is a mismatch between `hw_version` of the DFU package you want to use and your hardware. You can check it with the following command.

```
nrfutil nrf5sdk-tools pkg display my-dfu-file.zip |grep hw_version
```
`hw_version` must be equal to `0` for the Ultra and `1` for the Lite.

# CLI tools compilation

## ProxSpace: cmake error

The following error has been reported on some ProxSpace installations (why on some and not all is still unclear)

```
pm3 ~/ChameleonUltra/software/src$ cmake .
-- Building for: Ninja
-- The C compiler identification is GNU 10.3.0
-- Detecting C compiler ABI info
-- Detecting C compiler ABI info - failed
-- Check for working C compiler: C:/Users/moeya/Desktop/Chamelion/ProxSpace/msys2/mingw64/bin/cc.exe
-- Check for working C compiler: C:/Users/moeya/Desktop/Chamelion/ProxSpace/msys2/mingw64/bin/cc.exe - broken
CMake Error at C:/Users/moeya/Desktop/Chamelion/ProxSpace/msys2/mingw64/share/cmake-3.21/Modules/CMakeTestCCompiler.cmake:69 (message):
  The C compiler

    "C:/Users/xxx/ProxSpace/msys2/mingw64/bin/cc.exe"

  is not able to compile a simple test program.
```

This is due to a version of ninja not aware of the Windows paths. Fix:

```
pacman -R ninja --noconfirm
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-ninja --noconfirm
```

## cmake: Undefined reference to "pthread_create"

It has been reported that on some Linux systems cmake doesnt find pthread.

Make sure to have libpthread installed, the package may be named differently on your distro.

On ubuntu and same based systems it is the following command:
```
sudo apt install libpthread-stubs0-dev
```

If this doesnt fix it, you may need to set pthread in the LDFLAGS enviroment variable, this can be done by running the command with the enviroment variable at the beginning:

```
LDFLAGS=-pthread cmake ..
```

If the error still persists you may also need to provide a specific compiler version, you do that by adding the -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER argument:

```
LDFLAGS=-pthread cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-11 ..
```

The compiler needs to be installed too ofcourse, the package name may be differently on your distro.

On ubuntu and same based systems its the following command:

```
sudo apt install gcc-11 g++-11
```

The following ```cmake --build . --config Release``` should work again without modification.

# CLI usage

## InvalidException: Device unsupported cmd

You need to update the firmware of your Chameleon.
